     <h1 id="collection">Collection of personal data</h1>

    The Cricketer app for Android does not collect any personal data. All data entered in the app stay on the android device the app is running on. The user can use the "Share" functionality to send data collected by the app (for example by e-mail). The user thereby has full control about where his data is send to.
    <br><br>
    The Cricketer app has no functionality to communicate with servers. As such the app cannot collect IP address nor does it set any cookies. It does not track any data for analysis purposes nor does it send any data to the author of the app.

     <h1 id="rights">Right for information/deletion/revocation</h1>

    The DSGVO admits to request information free of charge from the owner of the app about which personal data is being collected. Additionally it admits request for deletion, revocation or correction of incorrect data.
    <br><br>
    As Cricketer doesn't collect any data outside of the device of the user, the author cannot delete or block data, just because there is no data collected. I'm anyhow happy to inform about that fact again on personal request.
